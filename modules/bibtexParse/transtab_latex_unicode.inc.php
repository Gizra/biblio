// This is a translation table for best-effort conversion from LaTeX to Unicode entities. It contains a comprehensive list of substitution strings for LaTeX characters,
// which are used with the 'T1' font encoding. Uses commands from the 'textcomp' package. Unicode characters that can't be matched uniquely are commented out.
